Shopware provides an easy way to create a plugin configuration without any implementing any frontend code: https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/plugin-fundamentals/add-plugin-configuration.html

While the underlying system for the internal configuration generation is very flexible, the `config.xml` file is the only way to leverage this system. This package aims to provide another method: code-based configuration generation.

## Is this a Shopware Plugin?

No. While this package is tied to Shopware, it won't react on any events on it's own. It is meant to be used by a Shopware plugin.

## How can add this package in a Shopware plugin?

First, the package has to be installed via composer:

```bash
composer require it-bens/shopware-code-based-plugin-configuration
```

This can be done in the plugin's `composer.json` file. But remember to enable composer in the plugin class.

```php
public function executeComposerCommands(): bool
{
    return true;
}
```

### The convenient way

> [!TIP]
> This is the recommended way to register the compiler passes if you don't plan to do modifications on you're own because the helper will always be up-to-date.

This package provides a little helper to register all Symfony compiler passes that are required to use it. It can be added to the plugin's `build` method.

```php
use ITB\ShopwareCodeBasedPluginConfiguration\DependencyInjection\CompilerPassHelper;

public function build(ContainerBuilder $container): void
{
    // ...
    parent::build($container);

    CompilerPassHelper::addCompilerPassesToContainerBuilder($container);
}
```

### The manual way

The `ConfigurationCardConfigReaderPass` will add all the services necessary for the configuration generation to the service container.

```php
use ITB\ShopwareCodeBasedPluginConfiguration\DependencyInjection\CompilerPass\ConfigurationCardConfigReaderPass;
use ITB\ShopwareCodeBasedPluginConfiguration\DependencyInjection\CompilerPass\ConfigurationCardProviderTaggingPass;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Compiler\PassConfig;

public function build(ContainerBuilder $container): void
{
    // ...
    parent::build($container);

    $container->addCompilerPass(new ConfigurationCardProviderTaggingPass(), PassConfig::TYPE_BEFORE_OPTIMIZATION, 1000);
    $container->addCompilerPass(new ConfigurationCardConfigReaderPass());
}
```

#### Why are the default configuration values missing?

While the mentioned compiler pass is sufficient to generate the plugin configuration at runtime, a convenient feature is missing: default values. The `ConfigurationCardConfigSaverPass` is required to "hack" into the Shopware plugin configuration persistence.

```php
use ITB\ShopwareCodeBasedPluginConfiguration\DependencyInjection\CompilerPass\ConfigurationCardConfigReaderPass;
use ITB\ShopwareCodeBasedPluginConfiguration\DependencyInjection\CompilerPass\ConfigurationCardConfigSaverPass;
use ITB\ShopwareCodeBasedPluginConfiguration\DependencyInjection\CompilerPass\ConfigurationCardProviderTaggingPass;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Compiler\PassConfig;

public function build(ContainerBuilder $container): void
{
    // ...
    parent::build($container);

    $container->addCompilerPass(new ConfigurationCardProviderTaggingPass(), PassConfig::TYPE_BEFORE_OPTIMIZATION, 1000);
    $container->addCompilerPass(new ConfigurationCardConfigReaderPass());
    $container->addCompilerPass(new ConfigurationCardConfigSaverPass());
}
```

For detailed information why this is necessary and why the usage is "hacky" look at [How does the package work? - Shopware plugin configuration persistence](#shopware-plugin-configuration-persistence).

#### What's that "TaggingPass"?

> [!NOTE]  
> Additional information. This is not required if the recommended way of compiler pass registration is used.

This package uses attribute-based tagging of services for the registration of `ConfigurationCardProvider` implementations. In a normal project, the registration of the attribute for autotagging could be done in the service configuration. In order not bother developers with this, a compiler pass was introduces for that. Unfortunately, the Symfony compiler pass that executes the actual logic of autotagging has a high priority (+100). In order to work correctly, the `ConfigurationCardProviderTaggingPass` has to be added with an even higher priority and in the first compiler step.

## How can I use this package?

### Coding the configuration into cards

This package provides classes to define configuration cards (as seen in the Shopware plugin administration).

A `ConfigurationCard` has a title in english, a title in german and a list of `ConfigurationInputField` objects. The supported `ConfigurationInputField` implementations are:
* `BoolField`
* `IntegerField`
* `SingleSelectField`
* `TextField`

Some of these implementations differ in their required information. But because they mostly require the same information, all require a `GeneralFieldInputInformation` object. Here is an example for a configuration card with all types of input fields:

```php
use ITB\ShopwareCodeBasedPluginConfiguration\ConfigurationCard;
use ITB\ShopwareCodeBasedPluginConfiguration\ConfigurationInputField\BoolField;
use ITB\ShopwareCodeBasedPluginConfiguration\ConfigurationInputField\IntegerField;
use ITB\ShopwareCodeBasedPluginConfiguration\ConfigurationInputField\SingleSelectField;
use ITB\ShopwareCodeBasedPluginConfiguration\ConfigurationInputField\SingleSelectFieldOption;
use ITB\ShopwareCodeBasedPluginConfiguration\ConfigurationInputField\TextField;
use ITB\ShopwareCodeBasedPluginConfiguration\GeneralFieldInputInformation;

$enabledFieldInformation = new GeneralFieldInputInformation(
    name: 'enabled', 
    labelInEnglish: 'Enabled', 
    labelInGerman: 'Aktiviert', 
    helpTextInEnglish: 'Enable or disable the feature', 
    helpTextInGerman: 'Aktiviere oder deaktiviere das Feature'
);
$enabledField = new BoolField(new GeneralFieldInformation(generalInformation: $enabledFieldInformation, defaultValue: false);

$integerFieldInformation = new GeneralFieldInputInformation(
    name: 'position', 
    labelInEnglish: 'Position', 
    labelInGerman: 'Position', 
    helpTextInEnglish: 'The position in the list', 
    helpTextInGerman: 'Die Position in der Liste'
);
$integerField = new IntegerField(new GeneralFieldInformation(generalInformation: $integerFieldInformation, defaultValue: 0);

$selectFieldInformation = new GeneralFieldInputInformation(
    name: 'color', 
    labelInEnglish: 'Color', 
    labelInGerman: 'Farbe', 
    helpTextInEnglish: 'The color of the item', 
    helpTextInGerman: 'Die Farbe des Elements'
);
$selectField = new SingleSelectField(
    new GeneralFieldInformation(generalInformation: $selectFieldInformation, defaultValue: 'red'),
    [
        new SingleSelectFieldOption(id: 'red', nameInEnglish: 'Red', nameInGerman: 'Rot'),
        new SingleSelectFieldOption(id: 'blue', nameInEnglish: 'Blue', nameInGerman: 'Blau'),
        new SingleSelectFieldOption(id: 'green', nameInEnglish: 'Green', nameInGerman: 'Gr√ºn'),
    ]
);

$textFieldInformation = new GeneralFieldInputInformation(
    name: 'description', 
    labelInEnglish: 'Description', 
    labelInGerman: 'Beschreibung', 
    helpTextInEnglish: 'A description of the item', 
    helpTextInGerman: 'Eine Beschreibung des Elements'
);
$textField = new TextField(new GeneralFieldInformation(generalInformation: $textFieldInformation, defaultValue: '');

$configurationCard = new ConfigurationCard(
    titleInEnglish: 'General Settings',
    titleInGerman: 'Allgemeine Einstellungen',
    inputFields: [$enabledField, $integerField, $selectField, $textField]
);
```

### Injecting the cards into the configuration

The package uses services that implement the `ConfigurationCardProvider` interface and use the `AsConfigurationCardProvider`. Because Shopware uses the same loading mechanism for all plugins, the scope of the `ConfigurationCardProvider` has to be declared. This is done in the `getBundleClasses` method of the plugin class.

```php
/**
 * @return class-string<Bundle>[]
 */
public function getBundleClasses(): array {
    return [
        YourPluginClass::class
    ];
}
```

The providers are sorted with the priority value of the `AsConfigurationCardProvider` tag.
The `getPriority` method is used to sort the providers if more than one provider is registered for the same plugin.

```php
use ITB\ShopwareCodeBasedPluginConfiguration\Attribute\AsConfigurationCardProvider;

#[AsConfigurationCardProvider(priority: 1000)]
...
```

And finally the `getConfigurationCards` method is used to return the configuration cards.

```php
/**
 * @return ConfigurationCard[]
 */
public function getConfigurationCards(): array {
    return $this->configurationCards;
}
```

## How does the package work?

The package decorates the `Shopware\Core\System\SystemConfig\Util\ConfigReader` service from Shopware. This service is used to read the `config.xml` file of a plugin. It decodes the XML file into an array. This package keeps the XML-based configuration of plugin and extends it with the data from matching configuration card providers.

The decoration is done via compiler pass in three steps:
1. all services that implement the `ConfigurationCardProvider` interface are collected and tagged.
2. a `ConfigurationCardProviderProvider` definition is created that receives all services from (1).
3. the `ConfigurationCardConfigReader` definition is created with decoration of the `Shopware\Core\System\SystemConfig\Util\ConfigReader` service and the `ConfigurationCardProviderProvider` is injected into the `ConfigurationCardConfigReader`.
4. the `ConfigurationCardConfigReader` is set as an alias for the `Shopware\Core\System\SystemConfig\Util\ConfigReader` service to replace it.

### Shopware plugin configuration persistence

Shopware saves plugin configurations in it's database as key-value pairs. When a plugin is installed, Shopware reads the configuration with the `Shopware\Core\System\SystemConfig\Util\ConfigReader` and persists the default values. However, the services of a plugin are added to the DI container during the plugin activation and not the installation. This means that the service decoration that allows the code-based configuration generation is not used during the installation. Only the default values from the `config.xml` file are persisted as a result.

This package provides a service subscriber that subscribes to the Shopware `PluginPostActivateEvent` and the `PluginPostUpdateEvent`. The service requires the plugin/bundle instance to perform the configuration persistence. The subscriber checks if the configuration persistence is necessary by using the plugin base class from the events the bundle classes defined in the registered `ConfigurationCardProvider` instances and fetches the plugin instance from the `KernelPluginCollection`service. The compiler pass takes care of the service definition, argument injection and the subscription tagging.

Shopware checks for already persisted configuration values and does not overwrite them. So multiple installations/deinstallations/activations/deactivations of a plugin that uses this package will not reset the configuration values unless the "remove all data" option is used.

The HTTP cache might be reset after the plugin activation. To avoid issues with the newly persisted configuration values, the event subscriber is registered with a priority of 100 to be executed as early as possible (at least earlier before other event subscribers with priority 0).
